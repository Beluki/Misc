/*
There is already an userstyle for Stylish that does this.

It can be found here:
<http://userstyles.org/styles/80904/hide-horizontal-scrollbar>

Unfortunately, it doesn't always work. It may be due to a bug
in Firefox. Sometimes you have to refresh pages for it to work,
which is annoying.

This one works. Period.
