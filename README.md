## About

This repository contains programs written as answers to Stack Overflow or IRC
questions, small experiments to test ideas or interesting code from other
projects that may be useful on its own, yet small enough not to warrant the
need for an additional repository.

* [A threadpool example with sorted, immediate feedback](Source/ThreadPool)
